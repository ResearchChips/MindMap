# 🧠 MindMap: A Collaborative Repository of Research Idea Diagrams

> "One diagram is worth a thousand words."

📌 **MindMap** is a collaborative academic repository for collecting and organizing **research idea diagrams**, **article summary sketches**, and **visual concept maps** from multiple contributors. These visual artifacts serve as structured blueprints for understanding complex papers, designing new ideas, and accelerating literature digestion.

## 📁 Repository Structure

```text
MindMap/ 
├── shared/ # Publicly shared diagrams and slides 
│ └── PPT/ 
│ └── DeepLearningBasicComponents.pptx 
├── zhli/ # Personal folder for user "zhli" 
│ └── PPT/ 
│ ├── Templates/ 
│ └── FrameworkTemplates.pptx
```

- Each collaborator maintains their own folder: `yourname/`
- Shared resources are placed in the `shared/` directory.
- Use PowerPoint (`.pptx`) or image formats (`.png`, `.svg`, `.pdf`) for diagrams.
- All diagrams should include paper references or brief context when possible.

## ✍️ Contribution Guidelines

✅ **What to include:**
- Flowcharts, conceptual mindmaps, and framework overviews from research papers.
- Annotated visualizations created during paper reading.
- Templates for visualizing methods (e.g., VLM, NeRF, GAN, etc.).
- Domain-specific tools or slides that aid academic work.

📐 **Naming convention:**
- Use clear, concise filenames like `TransformerOverview.pptx` or `NeRF_ArchitectureFlow.png`.
- For personal folders: `yourname/PPT/` or `yourname/Tools/`.

🧾 **Documentation:**
- For each figure or template, consider adding a short `.md` description or comment in the PPT itself to explain its source and purpose.
